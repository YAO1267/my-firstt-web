                Selva was born out of the love for all things wild and green. Our intention is clear—to introduce the finest South American forest açaí (as-a-ee) to Asia through sustainable harvesting methods and community-supported ecosystems.
                <br><br>
                Selva was born out of the love for all things wild and green and a deep sense that cross-cultural experiences enrich our lives and perspectives. Founded by a Singaporean and Brazilian, we live by those values.

                While living in São Paulo in 2014, we wanted our family and friends in South East Asia to experience a bit of what we had in Brazil: the food, the life, the way of living rooted in the appreciation of the simple things in life.
                <br><br>
                Returning to Singapore, it was decided we would craft, honor and share the true Brazilian way of eating acai—not as a powder, supplemented fruit in processed juice blends which have significantly smaller amounts of acai and preserved nutrients—but in the form of a simple wildest frozen purée.
                <br><br>
